# The site was made as a meme nothing more, but it's nice to see with your own eyes

This site was made to pass the project and have a laugh with the guys about how we are real mechanics

## Programming languages

CSS
HTML

## Description of my site

this site was made to help the guys on their gears get rid of the capital or the motor, 
as well as to see such poor fellows in person and tell them that not everything is lost (I used to be such a poor guy myself)

## Thank you guys for allowing me to upload them to your site.

## For the teacher
In the end, I would like to say that I hope that you will enter into a position since I worked seven days a week to earn money for a major overhaul of a car called LADA
